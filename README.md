Fancy-Flashlight
================

Skelware's Fancy Flashlight app for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8.1

By default this app will contain an on/off button, a slow and a fast flashing mode and an S.O.S. morse code transmitter! But you can easily create new profiles to flash at any speed you want for however long you want. Of course you could also just type in a nice sentence and the app will translate it into morse code for you! Now that might not be so useful... but it's certainly cool, right?! Did I mention that you can also let your flashlight respond to music? No? Well, it can!
